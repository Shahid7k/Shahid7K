### Let me walk you through my repositories.
<sub><sup> [ Note : The private ones are either the ones made while learning how stuff works in GitHub, or the ones I have some work pending on.
Let's see about the Public ones ]</sup></sub>

I'll keep it short and clear to understand.
I've included those of my main projects in the repositories here which might need a little introduction. <sub><sup>(Others are either private or not yet uploaded.)</sup></sub>

The included projects are : 

## â€ºâ€ºDeVlog
> This was a team project in which I collaborated with [Shraddha](https://github.com/shraddha099 "Shraddha-Collaborator-contributed some React-Context and Rich Text Editor related code ")
> The original idea was inclined towards Developersâ€™ Blogging, but while doing the project, we sought it fit for General Purpose Blogging (& QA) too. 
> + Blogging blended with a QA portal designed to handle large set of users.
> + Authorization: Editing and deleting blogs, questions, and profile data is made available only to the owning user along with _JWT Authentication._
> + UI/UX: Attempt to ease up the user-experience by carefully carving the UI.
